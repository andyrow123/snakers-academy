### Snakers Academy challenge sheet!

These challenges are just ideas. You are  **highly** encouraged to mess with everything as much as you can.

If at some point you do these things, I will be happy:
* Give things silly/rude names
* Put a zero on a random number in the code and see what happens.
* Really try and understand an error message (Google is your friend)
* Break everything beyond repair and start over.  

If you need a working version of snake, feel free to download [this repository](https://github.com/nazwhale/ruby-snake).

##### Easy

1) Change the Game Window caption from ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù to "Snakers Academy". Or your name, or an emoji (üêç), or some lewd pun involving snakes (Ereptile Disfunction, anyone?)

2) Make the snake go up by default (it currently goes right).

3) Play around with the starting speed of the snake. Make it really fast and go "wooooahhh" for 5 seconds, until you get bored. Then, mess with the increase in speed that comes with eating apples.

4) Make the apples blue. Now try rainbow coloured. If things don't behave as you expect, try Googling the `draw_quad` method, along with the word "Gosu" in your search query. Can you make sense of the documentation?

##### Medium

1) Currently, apples can spawn anywhere, including squares already occupied by the snake. Write a method to stop this from happening.

2) The apples don‚Äôt perfect align with the snake. Can you fix this?

3) Remember those `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor` things? Try Googling them to learn what they're all about. Then play around with removing them from the code. Can you make sense of the error messages?

##### Hard (like, seriously)

*Super legit bring-it-up-in-an-interview pro points for no. 1*

1) Think of an improvement you can make to my original repository (it's far from perfect). Next, make a GitHub account and see if you can figure out what a "Pull-Request" is. With a bit of research, you should be able to submit a pull request to my original repository ([here](https://github.com/nazwhale/ruby-snake)) with your improvement, which I can then accept or review.

*Open-source tangent:*

This is essentially what people mean when they say "contributing to open-source projects". In practice, it's about making improvements to other people's code via pull-requests.

Some huge projects have been made solely by developers around the world collaborating for no personal gain, other than the pleasure of making something. Read about some [here](https://medium.com/@likid.geimfari/the-list-of-interesting-open-source-projects-2daaa2153f7c).


2) Do some retro styling. This might mean adding some HTML and CSS.

3) Put it online ([Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) will host websites for free up to a certain amount of traffic)

4) Upgrade to Snake 2 (so you can go through the walls and come out the other side)
